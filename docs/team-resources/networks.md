# Networks

## What are networks?

Some resources such as database servers cannot exist without a network. Whenever you create one such resource on a region without a network, Ymir will ask you to create one. For most, that will be the extent of their interaction with networks.

## Managing networks

There are scenarios where you might want to create additional networks within the same region. You can use the `network:create` command to do so. You can also delete existing networks using the `network:delete` command.
